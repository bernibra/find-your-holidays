# find-your-holidays
This is by no means a way to avoid having actual holidays

This is a python dash app that I made to sort out the holidays and randomize working hours, avoiding to have to manually fill hour timesheets and wasting my research group's time. To see the app in action follow [this link](https://time-saving-sheet.herokuapp.com).

_In reality, I was in quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak, and I didn't want to work on the acutal projects (you know, with actual deadlines and all) so I decided to learn how to make python dash apps. They are fine, but I think I prefer shiny._
