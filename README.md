# find-your-holidays
This is by no means a way to avoid having actual holidays

This is a python dash app that I made to sort out the holidays and randomize working hours to avoid wasting all our time filling timesheets. To see the app in action follow [this link](https://time-saving-sheet.herokuapp.com)

In reality, I was in quarantine during the COVID19 outbreak, and I didn't want to work on the acutal projects (you know, with actual deadlines and all) so I decided to learn how to make python dash apps. They are fine, but I think I prefer shiny.
